                <h1> Aura</h1>
                <p> What is an Aura?
                    An Aura is your bodys energy field. There are seven layers to your Aura; Etheric layer, Emotional layer, Mental layer, Astral Bridge layer, Etheric Template layer, Celestial layer, Ketheric/Causal layer. The Etheric layer is the first layer of the aura after the physical body. It is conneced to the first chakra, the root. The etheric aura is the layer that corresponds to the physical life, feelings, physical pleasure, pain, health and wellbeing. The Emotional layer is the second aura layer which vibrates the frequency of emotions and feelings and affects emotional balance as a whole. The Emotional body is connected to the second chakra, the sacral chakra. The Emotional layer gives the opportunity to have desires, emotions, imagination and psychic abilities. The Mental layer is the third layer in the aura and it is connected to the solar plexus chakra. It facilitates our cognitive ability to know, have thoughts, beliefs, ideas and higher mental abilities. It also represents ego and personal power. The fourth layer is the Astral Bridge layer and it is associated with areas of expression of etheral, emotional and mental layer. It is connected to the fourth chakra, the Heart. It shows your capacity for conditional and unconditional love. The astral layer is also a bridge between the lower three layers and the higher three layers of the aura. Almost all healing energies come from the astral layer.  The Etheric Template layer is the fifth layer of the aura. It represents the entire blueprint of the body that exists on this physical plane. It is connected to the throat chakra and includes everything you create on this physical level including your identity, personality and overall energy. Diseases can be monitored and treated in this layer and be passed down to the physical body. It is activated by sound and strengthened by expressing your truth and knowing who you truly are. The Celestial layer is the sixth layer of the aura and is associated with enlightenment. It is connected to the third eye chakra. It consist of the visceral level, where we have access to higher intellectual knowledge and wisdom. The Celestial layer carries a very strong and powerful vibration that expresses the relationship with God, the Creator and unconditional love. It is developed through raising awareness, personal growth and creative visualization. It can also be stimulated through meditation. The last layer of the aura is the Ketheric Template layer and is associated with the divine and universal consciousness. It is connected to the seventh chakra, the crown. This is the layer where we become one with the Universe. It refers to our current incarnation and holds all information about your soul and previous lifetimes. This is the strongest and most resistant layer of the aura.

                <h1> Chakras </h1>
                <p> What Are Chakras?
                   The Chakras are seven key points in the body where energy flows in and around the human body.
