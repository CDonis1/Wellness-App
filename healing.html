                    What Are Healing Crystals?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Healing Crystals are semiprecious stones that harness the energy of the Sun, the Moon, and the Oceans. They connect us with the earth because they are tangible physical forms that have powerful vibrations. It takes a conscious effort to open your heart and mind to the power of crystal healing. With thought and intention crystals pick up your unique vibrational energy and amplify positive vibes. Crystal energy helps you on your spiritual journey by working to hold your intention and reminding you of your connection to the Earth. Each crystal has a unique vibrational energy that works to clear blockages and ward off negative energy. Crystals can contribute to one's healing by helping to activate a chakra that is closed, stimulating a slow spinning chakra and slowing down an over active chakra. Crystals are sacred stones that can be cleansed and charged for specific purposes, particularly for energy purification, healing, and for protection from negative energies.
                    <p class="col-md-6">
                     Before using a crystal for healing you need to make sure that the crystals are cleansed from any energies that they may have encountered before coming into contact with you. You can cleanse your crystal by using sage, palo santo or incense and visualizing the smoke removing negative energy.

                     You should also consider charging your crystal naturally with planetary energies. You can do this by setting the crystal out in the moonlight, sunlight or placing it in soil. To set a specific intention on the crystal hold them in your hand and say your intention in your mind while visualizing your intention coming to life. There are many different crystals that will work with each chakra. The color of the crystal will usually correspond to the color of a specific chakra.

                    What Are Solfeggio Frequencies?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Solfeggio frequencies make up the ancient 6-tone scale thought to have been used in sacred music. Each Solfeggio tone is comprised of a frequency required to balance your energy and keep your body, mind and spirit in perfect harmony. The ancient Solfeggio scale can be traced back to a Medieval hymn to John the Baptist. In the mid-1970’s Dr. Joseph Puleo, a physician and America’s leading herbalist, found six electro-magnetic sound frequencies that corresponded to the syllables from the hymn to St. John the Baptist. The syllables used to denote the tones are: Ut, Re, Mi Fa, Sol, La. They were taken from the first stanza of the hymn to St. John the Baptist:

                    Literal translation from Latin: “In order that the slaves might resonate (resound) the miracles (wonders) of your creations with loosened (expanded) vocal chords. Wash the guilt from (our) polluted lip. Saint John.”
                    
                    In other words, so people could live together in peace and communicate in harmony about the miracle in their lives, and how God blessed them to produce this “magic”, people’s true unpolluted spiritual natures required revelation. The above text seems to suggest that Solfeggio notes open up a channel of communication with the Divine.
